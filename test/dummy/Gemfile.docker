gem "api_keys", "~> 0.1"

# When making changes to the regular Gemfile, we need to copy here everything below `gemspec path: "../.."`
# This is because parent directories to this Rails app are not available to Docker when compiling the app
# so the api_keys gem code is unavailable for deployment because there's no gemspec
# so we need to fetch the latest version on RubyGem to deploy the demo app
# and we keep the regular Gemfile for developing and testing with the bleeding edge version of our gem

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!
# !!IMPORTANT!!
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!
# After editing this Gemfile, we need to run this:
#
#    BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.docker bundle instal
#
# to compile the Gemfile.lock file for Docker
